## Inspiration
The province of Alberta is full of smart people. According to the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers, the number of engineers that resided in Alberta per one-thousand people was 9.0 while the national average was 4.6 in 2017. 
Although there is a lot of enthusiasm towards the blockchain technology and the promise it holds, there aren't many opportunities to collaborate, learn and start-up businesses in this sphere. This DAO is an attempt to solve this problem by incentivizing individuals learn, collaborate and spread the world about this exciting new technology that is stealthily taking over the world. 
## What it does
This DAO aims to create (or more precisely, encourage the creation of) 1000 Blockchain Engineers the in the province of Alberta. Each DAO owner will be entitled to one Oil Token. The token name was chosen for two reasons. 
1. As tribute to all the hardworking men and women in Alberta's Oil and Gas industry
2. The highlight tokens role as the fuel that keeps the project on track to achieve its goal 
The token gets its value the DAO’s treasury account. Corporate and individual sponsors and patrons can contribute ETH to the DAO. Upon successful achievement of the DAO’s objective, the Oil tokens will unlock and each of the token holder can redeem 1/1000th of the DAO’s treasury account balance. Upon redemption the OIL token will be burned. 
Should the DAO fail to meet its objective within the allotted timeframe, the contributions will be return to the contributors minus any network/transaction fees. 
Various parameters of the DAO will be “Governable” by the token holders and sponsors are encouraged to change parameters of the DAO as the project evolves. 
Each member has one vote and sponsors have 5 votes.
